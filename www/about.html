      <h2>What is microhost?</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Microhost is a modest web host that takes a different approach to having a small Internet presence.
        This site offers a 100kB web space that you can use for up to 7 days for any lawful (US law) use.
        This is my little Internet experiment to promote anonymous free speech on a politics agnostic platform.
      </p>
      <p>If you find a positive use for this or want to support it, please tell you friends.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Anticipated Questions (No one has actually asked anything yet!)</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Do I need to sign up for an account?</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Microhost does not require any user signup, email addresses, or any personally identifable information.
        The belief is that you can register a site, obtain your site key, and publish your message.
        Microhost does not use any cookies for tracking purposes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>What do I get with my site registration?</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Anyone who registers a site on Microhost gets 100kB of web space for up to 7 days. Your site is in the form of a single page.
      </p>
    </div>


    <div>
      <h3>Why are there limits on space and an expiration?</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        In exchange for providing a completely free service and controlling for limited resources, all sites are set to expire in up to a week from creation.
        100kB of text is also a good amount of space for a lot of uses. Consider that <a href = "https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1533/1533-0.txt">MacBeth</a> in plain text form comes in at about 128kB.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Why can I only upload text?</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        There are tons of sites, such as imgur that will allow you to host images. In order to preserve space and keep things simple, you are free to
        publish up to 100kB of html or plain text. For users wanting to publish sites with images, I encourage you to link to an image hosting site.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Are there any limits on the amount of sites I can create?</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        You are limited to 3 microhost sites per IP address and this site currently has a hard limit of 1500 total sites. This may change in the future if necessary.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>I found a site hosted that is offensive or illegal. What do I do?</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Offensive content, that is legal under US free speech laws, are permissible and you are free to host your own content in opposition to any offensive content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Illegal content will be taken down when discovered. If you find any material that is illegal, please email <a href = "mailto:abuse@mhst.site">abuse@mhst.site</a>
        with the site URL and it will be reviewed and dealt with accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>Anyone who does post illegal material will be permanently banned from creating sites in the future.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        I actually thought about building this for another decentralized broadcasting application I want to write to allow meta-data to be posted up on a site without having
        to sign up for a web webhost. This transformed into allowing anyone with something worth sharing to post their thoughts etc. for a limited about of time. This is an Internet
        experiment and may end up just being a passing curiosity.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Why is the page design mediocre?</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Front end web design is not my strong suit. I am working on making it incrementally better. Please  <a href = "mailto:info@mhst.site">contact me</a>, if you'd like to help.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Isn't this just pastebin?</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        Come to think of it, sort of, with the additional utility of being oriented towards delivering media rich HTML or text.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>How do I get in contact with you?</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        For general inquiries, please shoot a note to <a href = "mailto:info@mhst.site">info@mhst.site</a>.
      </p>
